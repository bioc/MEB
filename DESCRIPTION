Description: Identifying differential expression genes between the
    same or different species is an urgent demand for biological research.
    In most of cases, normalization is the first step to solve this problem,
    then by employing the hypothesis testing, we could detect statistically
    significant genes. With the development of machine learning, it gives
    us a new perspective on discrimination between differential expression
    (DE) and non-differential expression (non-DE) genes. Provided
    a set of training data, the procedure of distinguishing genes could be
    simplified as a classification problem. However, in reality, it is hard for
    us to get the information from both DE and non-DE genes. To solve
    this problem, we try to identify differential cases only in the domain of
    non-DE genes, and transform the problem to an outlier detection in
    machine learning.
    Given that non-DE genes have some similarities in features,
    we build a Minimum Enclosing Ball (MEB) to cover those non-DE
    genes in feature space, then those DE genes, which are enormously
    different from non-DE genes, being regarded as outliers and rejected
    outside the ball. Compared with existing methods, it is no need for
    the MEB method to normalize data in advance. Besides, the MEB
    method could be easily applied to the same or different species data
    and without changing too much.
