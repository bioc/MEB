Description: This package provides a method to identify differential expression 
    genes in the same or different species. Given that non-DE genes have some 
    similarities in features, a scaling-free minimum enclosing ball (SFMEB)
    model is built to cover those non-DE genes in feature space, then those DE 
    genes, which are enormously different from non-DE genes, being regarded as 
    outliers and rejected outside the ball. The method on this package is 
    described in the article 'A minimum enclosing ball method to detect 
    differential expression genes for RNA-seq data'. The SFMEB method is 
    extended to the scMEB method that considering two or more potential types 
    of cells or unknown labels scRNA-seq dataset DEGs identification.
